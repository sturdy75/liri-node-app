This idea behind this "liri" app is to mimic the basic functionality of a digital "assistant" such as Alexa, or Cortana. You can enter in some basic commands to do 
things like look up information on a song, movie, or band.

The basic commands to enable the information search are as follows:

* "Spotify-this-song" followed by the name of a song will return information from Spotify about the song.

*  "Movie-this" followed by the name of a movie will return    information from OMDB about the movie.

*  "Concert-this" followed by the name of a band/artist will return information from Bands in Town about the artist.

*  Typing in "Do-What-it-Says" will display all of the possible commands available to the user for a full "liri" experience.

This product is useful to find information about a few popular topics all in one place.

To get started with "liri" all you have to do is type "do-what-it-says" in the console for a list of commands.

If there are any questions about the general functionality you may feel free to send an email to sturdy75@gmail.com
